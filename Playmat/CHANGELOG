  - fix bug related to card back image in editor client when server cant find it
  - write new PlaymatServer class with shared code, make subclasses recieve a

  - have editor client handle the image info string and store the intended image
    list index, receive the bytes, and then stream them into a bufferedimage via
    imageio
  - remove -Dawt-headless=true when starting servers with playmatweb
  - stop using ImageIcon to transfer image data from editor server to client,
    and write function that sends a string with the image index, followed by the
    raw bytes of the image file
  - put for loop inside of try (rather than vice versa) in ImageSendRun.run and
    remove the now unneeded break call if a client goes away during image send
  - implement editor server sending and logging of user actions, and have client
    print them to stdout
  - remove isConnected check in Client.send
  - remove superfluous calls to setChanged/notifyObservers in the connect
    function of client subclasses

0.1.1 (July 05 2009)
  - catch socket closed exceptions in Client.read and be silent
  - catch an arrayindex exception and print a warning that the image transfer
    was interrupted if the client wants to disconnect before all images are sent
  - relax output stream resetting on image transfer from every 4 images to 10
  - print out an error when sending on a broken pipe
  - catch socket closed exceptions on Server.send and Server.disconnect, and be
    silent, as they indicate a client who disconnected at an opportune time, and
    closing the socket attempts to contact the client again
  - send first decks vector without needlessly resetting the output stream
  - fix playmatweb navigation not disabling the links to the current page
    on some php configurations
  - inform admin of no registered users on admin instead of an empty list

  - modify regular expression for new/rename deck check in editor server to
    allow spaces and numbers
  - fix add card button sometimes not being disabled when it should be in editor
  - initialize keep alive timer _after_ binding, thereby fix a bug where
    the server would hang on a bind exception upon startup

  - clear image cache on client disconnect to fix memory leak
  - flush previous image on change in CardPanel to fix client memory leak
